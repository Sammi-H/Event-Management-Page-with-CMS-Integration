Event Page with CMS Integration
Overview
This project is a dynamic Event Page that fetches data from a CMS (Content Management System). The website has three main pages: a homepage, a list of events, and an event detail page. The events are dynamically fetched from the CMS, and the project is built using Next.js and the App Router. This project demonstrates how to integrate a CMS with a Next.js application to display event data such as titles, descriptions, images, dates, and locations.

Main Features:
Homepage: Displays one event with a title, image, and description.

Events List Page: Displays a list of events with relevant details.

Event Detail Page: Displays detailed information for each event, fetched dynamically based on the event's unique slug.

CMS Integration: Data (title, description, date, image, location, etc.) is fetched dynamically from a CMS.

Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Technologies Used
Next.js (App Router): A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.

Sanity.io: A headless CMS that serves event data to the Next.js app. This allows dynamic content management.

CSS (Custom Styles): For styling and responsive layout, including media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.

React: Used as the JavaScript library for building the UI components of the website.
